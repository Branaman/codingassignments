// For a Few Billion
// There is an old tale about a king who offered a servant $10,000 as a reward. The servant instead asked that for 30 days he be given an amount that would double, starting with a penny. (1 penny for the first day, 2 for the second, 4 for the third, then 8, 16, 32 pennies, and so on).
//
// Use for loops to answer the following:
//
// How much was the reward after 30 days?
// remember, a penny isn't 1, but 0.01
//
// Bonus (Only If You Have Time):
//
// How many days would it take the servant to make $10,000?
// How about 1 billion?
// In JavaScript, there is a value Infinity, how many days until the servant has infinite money?
function servantPay(days,max) {
  var pay = .01;
  var counter = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i <= days; i++) {
    pay = pay*2;
    counter = counter+1;
    if (max <= pay) {
      return counter+" days";
    }
  }
  return "$"+pay;
}
